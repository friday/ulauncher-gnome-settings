# ulauncher-gnome-settings

[Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io) extension for accessing Gnome settings (Gnome Control Center panels) directly as if they were apps.

This extension was originally written for Ulauncher v5, using a hack to make Ulauncher keywords look and behave like apps. This was cumbersome and came with some caveats.

This branch however is updated for Ulauncher v6 (currently unreleased) and implements the same thing without workarounds. 

Furthermore, the extension is pointless for v6, since Ulauncher v6 includes these gnome settings by default. So you should just remove this extension for v6.
